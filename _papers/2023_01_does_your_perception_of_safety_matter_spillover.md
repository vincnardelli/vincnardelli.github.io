# Abstract
This study aims to examine the organizational and network-level factors that determine patients’ perception of safety during the Covid-19 pandemic. We used a unique database of 366 oncological patients and 68 breast unit team leaders operating within the Italian NHS. We used spatial econometric models to test our hypotheses. Our results reveal the importance of team stability and continuity in the provision of care in patients’ perception of safety. We also highlight the invisible network between patients with similar conditions and the circumstances they experience.

# Abstract
Spatial information and aggregate data on the number of verified infected, either hospitalized or in compulsory quarantine, are utilized to improve a standard two-stage sampling design broadly adopted for studying human populations. The basic strategy, is based on spatially balanced sampling. The conditions for their efficiency are analytically proven. The relative advantages are shown through a simulation study.
